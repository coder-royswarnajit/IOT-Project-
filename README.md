Solar-Powered Battery Charging System (Cisco Packet Tracer Simulation)
üìù Aim

To design and simulate a battery charging system powered by a solar panel using Cisco Packet Tracer, demonstrating how renewable energy can be utilized for sustainable power management in IoT environments.

üîç Problem Statement

Conventional battery systems rely heavily on grid electricity for charging, which is not sustainable in remote or energy-constrained environments. The challenge is to design a system that charges a battery using solar energy, ensuring uninterrupted power availability while reducing dependency on conventional sources.

This project uses Cisco Packet Tracer to simulate the working of a solar-powered charging system, enabling students and researchers to study renewable energy applications in IoT setups.

üåç Scope of the Solution

Demonstrates renewable energy integration into IoT systems.

Provides a simulation model for educational and research purposes.

Can be extended to real-world scenarios involving:

Smart homes

Remote IoT sensor networks

Off-grid communication devices

Encourages sustainability by reducing carbon footprint.
